# Code_Quiz
This is Code_Quiz

This project is a quiz that asks five basic questions about coding.

The user picks from four choices for each question, giving them a total score out of five when the quiz ends.

If the user selects a wrong answer for any particular question, he/she will be deducted time from the 75 seconds allotted to complete the quiz.

There are two ways the quiz can end:
    
    The user answers all five questions.
    
    The timer runs out without all questions answered.

At the end of the quiz the user will be asked to enter his/her initials attached to their score. This score will be added into local storage.
